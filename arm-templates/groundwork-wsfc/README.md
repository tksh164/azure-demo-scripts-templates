    You can also run the following from **[Run command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/run-command)** in Azure portal that able to run it without RDP connections.

    ```powershell
    cd C:\work
    .\lang-step1.ps1 lang-ws2019-jajp.psd1
    ```

2. Change language related settings by `lang-step2.ps1`. The system reboots after finish the script. This script takes less a minute for running.
